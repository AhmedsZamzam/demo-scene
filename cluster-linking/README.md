# Cluster Linking Demo

Cluster Linking allows two or more clusters to directly connect at the broker level. It eliminates the need to monitor, secure, and scale 
another distributed system (e.g. Kafka Connect) to replicate data from one cluster to another--all while preserving offsets to help rationalize about the state of the system.

For information on how to run this demo, please reference the Confluent documentation [here](https://docs.confluent.io/current/multi-dc-deployments/cluster-linking/index.html).

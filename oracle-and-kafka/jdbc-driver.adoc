= Kafka Connect JDBC connector and JDBC Drivers

== Introduction

This is a very common error that people encounter when using the Kafka Connect JDBC connector:

```
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found forâ€¦
```

e.g.

```
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.10.10.10:1954/MYSERVICE
```

It means that *either*: 

1. You have specific the JDBC URL in the wrong format. Check against https://gist.github.com/fabriciocolombo/3375118[this useful list] to make sure it's correct.
2. The JDBC driver for your database has not been correctly made available to Kafka Connect

== Making the JDBC connector available to Kafka Connect

Follow this one weird trick to make it work: 

1. Put the JDBC driver in the *same folder as the Kafka Connect JDBC plugin*. 
2. Restart the Kafka Connect worker

_Don't muck about with `CLASSPATH`, or `plugin.path`, or anything else that the Interwebs might throw up. So long as the correct JDBC driver is within the same folder as the Kafka Connect plugin JAR (`kafka-connect-jdbc-5.4.1.jar`), you're sorted._

== Locating the Kafka Connect JDBC plugin

1. Search for it
+
[source,bash]
----
find / -name kafka-connect-jdbc\*.jar
----
+
If you find more than one folder, you need to determine *which* plugin Kafka Connect is loading. 

2. Check the Kafka Connect worker log (`grep` for `jdbc` and `pluginLocation`)
+
[source,bash]
----

== Sample JDBC Source connector config

[source,bash]
----
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:8083/connectors/jdbc_source_oracle_01/config \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
            "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
            "connection.url": "jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle:1521/ORCLPDB1",
            "connection.user": "rmoff",
            "connection.password": "asgard",
            "mode":"bulk",
            "topic.prefix":"oracle_",
            "table.whitelist":"CUSTOMERS",
            "poll.interval.ms" : 10000
        }'

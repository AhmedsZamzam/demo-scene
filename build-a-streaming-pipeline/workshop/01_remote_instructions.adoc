= ksqlDB workshop - connecting to remote environment that's been provisioned for you

NOTE: Do not try to follow this if you're running the stack locally :) 

== What you will need

1. An SSH client. 
+
* On the Mac and Linux you have one already (`Terminal`). 
* On Windows https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[PuTTY] or https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] are popular choices. 
* You can also use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/related[`Secure Shell App`] plugin for the Chrome web browser if you want. 

2. The IP address of the machine that's been provisioned for you - speak to the instructor if you do not have this.

3. The SSH private key for connecting to the server. Your instructor will provide this. Copy it to a path on your machine, such as the Downloads folder. 

== Connect to the server

How you do this depends on the SSH client you're using. 

=== Mac/Linux 

Make sure you have the private key. Set the permissions on it so that only your user can read it (otherwise the ssh connection will fail). Use the appropriate path for where you have saved the key. 

[source,bash]
----
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/qcon-ldn-workshop.rsa
----

Use `ssh` from the Terminal to connect to the server, using the `-i` option to tell it to use the SSH key

[source,bash]
----
ssh -i ~/Downloads/qcon-ldn-workshop.rsa ec2-user@1.2.3.4
----

Replace `1.2.3.4` with the IP address of the server that you've been given. 

You'll get a warning: 

[source,bash]
----
The authenticity of host '1.2.3.4 (1.2.3.4)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:JAoWP5aRvtYu1M4UgPwSewy0/+9lBNdWo2+RahoYxNs.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
----

Enter `yes` and you should get the shell prompt for your remote server: 

[source,bash]
----
Warning: Permanently added '1.2.3.4' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

[ec2-user@ip-10-0-0-53 ~]$
----

Now follow the instructions below **ksqlDB prompt**, and then open a second terminal window, repeat the above process to login to the remote server, and then start a **MySQL prompt** following the separate instructions below. 

=== Windows

Connect using the IP address given, username `ec2-user`. Provide the SSH key to your SSH client.

1. Click `Import` and upload the private key
2. From the dropdown menu select the private key that you uploaded
3. Set `username` to `ec2-user`
4. Set `hostname` to the IP address of your server
5. Click **Connect**

== Start your ksqlDB prompt

On the remote server you've just connected to, run the following: 

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it $(docker ps|grep ksqldb|awk '{print $11}') ksql http://localhost:8088

= ATM Fraud Detection with Kafka and KSQL - Hands on Guide

v1.10, November 22, 2018

== Running the test rig

=== Setup

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene.git
cd ksql-atm-fraud-detection
docker-compose up -d
----

This brings up the stack, and also loads the necessary Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch, and Kibana configuration. It also launches the ATM data generator, streaming events to the `atm_txns_gess` topic.

=== KSQL application

Launch the CLI: 

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose exec ksql-cli ksql http://ksql-server:8088
----

Inspect source transactions: 

[source,sql]
----
PRINT 'atm_txns_gess' FROM BEGINNING;
----

Show in Kibana: http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dashboard/atm-transactions?_g=(refreshInterval:(pause:!f,value:30000),time:(from:now-15m,mode:quick,to:now))[All ATM transactions]


Register the topic as a KSQL stream: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM ATM_TXNS_GESS (account_id VARCHAR, \
                            atm VARCHAR, \
                            location STRUCT<lon DOUBLE, \
                                            lat DOUBLE>, \
                            amount INT, \
                            timestamp VARCHAR, \
                            transaction_id VARCHAR) \
            WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='atm_txns_gess', \
            VALUE_FORMAT='JSON', \
            TIMESTAMP='timestamp', \
            TIMESTAMP_FORMAT='yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss X');
----

Query the stream: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'), ACCOUNT_ID, ATM, AMOUNT\
        FROM ATM_TXNS_GESS \
        LIMIT 5;

2018-11-23 11:57:45 +0000 | a136 | ATM : 48930597 | 200
2018-11-23 11:57:46 +0000 | a552 | ATM : 1626440972 | 300
2018-11-23 11:57:47 +0000 | a250 | Barclays | 400
2018-11-23 11:57:47 +0000 | a327 | ATM : 1182516742 | 300
2018-11-23 11:57:48 +0000 | a973 | ATM : 5920382950 | 400
----

Create a clone of the stream: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM ATM_TXNS_GESS_02 WITH (PARTITIONS=1) AS \
        SELECT * FROM ATM_TXNS_GESS;
----

Join the stream (two in practice, but logically still just a single Kafka topic).
Also calculate time between two events (useful for spotting past-joins, not future).

[source,sql]
----
SELECT S1.ACCOUNT_ID, \
        TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S1.ROWTIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'), TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S2.ROWTIME, 'HH:mm:ss'), \
        (S2.ROWTIME - S1.ROWTIME)/1000, \
        S1.ATM, S2.ATM, \
        S1.TRANSACTION_ID ,S2.TRANSACTION_ID \
FROM   ATM_TXNS_GESS S1 \
       INNER JOIN ATM_TXNS_GESS_02 S2 \
        WITHIN 10 MINUTES \
        ON S1.ACCOUNT_ID = S2.ACCOUNT_ID \
LIMIT 40;

----

Filter out : 

* direct matches to self
* those in the same location. 
* Joins to past-dated events. 

[source,sql]
----
SELECT S1.ACCOUNT_ID, \
        TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S1.ROWTIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'), TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S2.ROWTIME, 'HH:mm:ss'), \
        (S2.ROWTIME - S1.ROWTIME)/1000 , \
        S1.ATM, S2.ATM \
FROM   ATM_TXNS_GESS S1 \
       INNER JOIN ATM_TXNS_GESS_02 S2 \
        WITHIN (0 MINUTES, 10 MINUTES) \
        ON S1.ACCOUNT_ID = S2.ACCOUNT_ID \
WHERE   S1.TRANSACTION_ID != S2.TRANSACTION_ID \
  AND   (S1.location->lat != S2.location->lat OR \
         S1.location->lon != S2.location->lon) \
  AND   S2.ROWTIME != S1.ROWTIME \
LIMIT 20;
----

Derive distance between ATMs & calculate required speed: 

[source,sql]
----
SELECT S1.ACCOUNT_ID, \
        TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S1.ROWTIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'), TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(S2.ROWTIME, 'HH:mm:ss'), \
        (CAST(S2.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE) - CAST(S1.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE)) / 1000 / 60 AS MINUTES_DIFFERENCE,  \
        CAST(GEO_DISTANCE(S1.location->lat, S1.location->lon, S2.location->lat, S2.location->lon, 'KM') AS INT) AS DISTANCE_BETWEEN_TXN_KM, \
        GEO_DISTANCE(S1.location->lat, S1.location->lon, S2.location->lat, S2.location->lon, 'KM') / ((CAST(S2.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE) - CAST(S1.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE)) / 1000 / 60 / 60) AS KMH_REQUIRED, \
        S1.ATM, S2.ATM \
FROM   ATM_TXNS_GESS S1 \
       INNER JOIN ATM_TXNS_GESS_02 S2 \
        WITHIN (0 MINUTES, 10 MINUTES) \
        ON S1.ACCOUNT_ID = S2.ACCOUNT_ID \
WHERE   S1.TRANSACTION_ID != S2.TRANSACTION_ID \
  AND   (S1.location->lat != S2.location->lat OR \
         S1.location->lon != S2.location->lon) \
  AND   S2.ROWTIME != S1.ROWTIME \
LIMIT 20;
----


Persist as a new stream: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM ATM_POSSIBLE_FRAUD  \
    WITH (PARTITIONS=1) AS \
SELECT S1.ROWTIME AS TX1_TIMESTAMP, S2.ROWTIME AS TX2_TIMESTAMP, \
        GEO_DISTANCE(S1.location->lat, S1.location->lon, S2.location->lat, S2.location->lon, 'KM') AS DISTANCE_BETWEEN_TXN_KM, \
        (S2.ROWTIME - S1.ROWTIME) AS MILLISECONDS_DIFFERENCE,  \
        (CAST(S2.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE) - CAST(S1.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE)) / 1000 / 60 AS MINUTES_DIFFERENCE,  \
        GEO_DISTANCE(S1.location->lat, S1.location->lon, S2.location->lat, S2.location->lon, 'KM') / ((CAST(S2.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE) - CAST(S1.ROWTIME AS DOUBLE)) / 1000 / 60 / 60) AS KMH_REQUIRED, \
        S1.ACCOUNT_ID AS ACCOUNT_ID, \
        S1.TRANSACTION_ID, S2.TRANSACTION_ID, \
        S1.AMOUNT, S2.AMOUNT, \
        S1.ATM, S2.ATM, \
        CAST(S1.location->lat AS STRING) + ',' + CAST(S1.location->lon AS STRING) AS TX1_LOCATION, \
        CAST(S2.location->lat AS STRING) + ',' + CAST(S2.location->lon AS STRING) AS TX2_LOCATION \
FROM   ATM_TXNS_GESS S1 \
       INNER JOIN ATM_TXNS_GESS_02 S2 \
        WITHIN (0 MINUTES, 10 MINUTES) \
        ON S1.ACCOUNT_ID = S2.ACCOUNT_ID \
WHERE   S1.TRANSACTION_ID != S2.TRANSACTION_ID \
  AND   (S1.location->lat != S2.location->lat OR \
         S1.location->lon != S2.location->lon) \
  AND   S2.ROWTIME != S1.ROWTIME;
----

View the resulting transactions: 

[source,sql]

        TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(TX1_TIMESTAMP, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'), TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(TX2_TIMESTAMP, 'HH:mm:ss'), \
